# Wheel, Snipe, Celly- NHL Team Tracker
Makeup for project 1

# My Experience
My initial vision for this application was much farther reaching, involving a div to populate with upcoming game and divs for the past five games. I basically ran my head into a wall until realizing the API would never pull an upcoming game and inputting previous games would involve making a function to determine when those games happened. Upon hitting this wall I pivoted back to an initial "add-on" I'd envisioned in the form of some basic team facts.

# User Story
AS an avid NHL Fan <br>
I WANT to be able to find out basic facts about teams around the league<br>
SO THAT I can further my knowledge <br>

# App Functionality
This app allows you to select a team using a dropdown and populate a div with basic information

# Project Requirements
Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input) <br>
Must be deployed to GitHub Pages <br>
Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals) <br>
Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.) <br>
Must have a polished, mobile-first UI <br>
Use at least one new third-party API <br>
Must use a CSS framework (Bootstrap/Foundation/Bulma/Skeleton/etc) <br>
Must use at least two server-side APIs (adjusted to one to accomodate solo project) <br>
