Makeup for project 1

# My Experience


# User Story
AS an avid NHL Fan
I WANT to be able to track game results and standings by team
SO THAT I can keep up to date with my favorite teams around the league

# Project Requirements
Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals).
Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
Must have a polished, mobile-first UI
Use at least one new third-party API
Must use a CSS framework (Bootstrap/Foundation/Bulma/Skeleton/etc)
Must use at least two server-side APIs (adjusted to one to accomodate solo project)
